# example git workflow

# create file blah.txt, edit it

# now add the file to git for the first time
git add blah.txt

# commit the file
git commit -m "this is the first commit message for blah.txt"

# pull before pushing in case someone else has edited it
# if this results in a merge conflict, send me an email
# I don't think it will be a problem though, if we coordinate properly
git pull

# push the file to github
git push

# make another edit in blah.txt

# add the file again (this is called "staging" the file)
git add blah.txt

# commit/pull/push as usual
